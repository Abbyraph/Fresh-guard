Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: FreshGuard – Food Expiration Tracker & Reminders
Version 1.0
1. Overview
1.1 Problem Statement

People regularly buy groceries, forget about them, and only rediscover items after they’ve expired—leading to waste and unnecessary spending. Existing tools are too manual or do not integrate barcode scanning, reminders, or intuitive inventory visualization.

1.2 Solution

FreshGuard is a progressive web app (PWA) that helps users track food items in their refrigerator or pantry. Users can scan barcodes or manually add items, and the system will assign an expected shelf life. Items are displayed in a visual “fridge dashboard,” and users receive automated reminders before items expire.

1.3 Goals

Reduce food waste

Simplify tracking through barcode scanning

Create a clean, intuitive dashboard

Provide timely notifications (push/email)

1.4 Target Users

College students

Families

Busy professionals

2. Key Features
2.1 Barcode Scanning

Use mobile device camera to scan UPC/EAN barcodes.

Identify products via barcode lookup API.

If item is not found, prompt user to create a custom entry.

Auto-suggest shelf life based on category (e.g., dairy, produce, meat).

Functional Requirements

FR-1: User can open a scanning interface using the device camera.

FR-2: System sends barcode to third-party lookup API.

FR-3: If product match exists → return product name + category.

FR-4: If no match → ask user for name, category, and optionally upload image.

2.2 Manual Item Entry

Add items without barcodes.

Category selector: Produce, Dairy, Meat, Pantry, Frozen, Other.

User enters purchase date; expiration date autocalculated.

Functional Requirements

FR-5: User can manually enter product name, category, and purchase date.

FR-6: System calculates expiration from internal shelf-life table.

FR-7: User may override shelf-life with a custom expiration date.

2.3 Shelf-Life Database

Preloaded table of average shelf lives for common food categories.

Editable by users (per item).

Functional Requirements

FR-8: System contains default shelf-life values.

FR-9: Shelf life is applied automatically based on category.

FR-10: Values stored in SQLite database via Flask backend.

2.4 Fridge Dashboard

Grid or card-based layout.

Items sorted by time-to-expiration.

Color coding:

Green: > 72 hours left

Yellow: 24–72 hours

Red: < 24 hours

Gray: expired

Filters: category, added date, soonest-to-expire.

Functional Requirements

FR-11: Show name, date added, expiration date, and time remaining.

FR-12: Allow edit/delete from item card.

FR-13: Allow filtering by category and expiration urgency.

2.5 Reminders & Notifications

Push notifications (PWA) and/or email alerts.

User selects frequency:

Immediate when < 24 hours left

Daily digest

Weekly digest

Functional Requirements

FR-14: User can enable push notifications (browser/device).

FR-15: User can provide email for alerts.

FR-16: Scheduled background jobs (cron or APScheduler) send reminders.

FR-17: Expiration logic checks timestamps daily.

2.6 Progressive Web App Support

Installable on iOS/Android

Offline storage for previously-loaded data

Background sync for reminders

Functional Requirements

FR-18: App includes a Web Manifest and service worker.

FR-19: Offline caching of key UI screens.

FR-20: Barcode scanning must work offline (cached JS library).

2.7 Authentication (Optional v1)

Email/password OR Google login.

Local anonymous mode allowed.

Functional Requirements

FR-21: Secure login (JWT or Flask sessions).

FR-22: Users can remain anonymous, with local storage only.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance

Barcode scan response < 1.5 seconds.

Dashboard load time < 1 second on local data.

3.2 Security

Store minimal data.

HTTPS required.

Do not store credit card or sensitive personal information.

3.3 Reliability

Reminders must run daily without manual triggers.

Offline mode must support viewing (not full editing).

4. Architecture & Tech Stack
4.1 Frontend

JavaScript + Bootstrap for UI

Camera-based barcode scanning (e.g., QuaggaJS or html5-qrcode)

Service Worker for PWA offline caching

4.2 Backend

Flask (Python)

Routes for:

Item CRUD

Notification scheduling

User authentication (optional)

Background scheduler:

APScheduler or cron to trigger daily expiration checks

4.3 Database

SQLite
Tables:

users

items

shelf_life

settings (notification preferences)

4.4 External Services

Barcode lookup API (e.g., UPCItemDB)

Email API (SendGrid or Flask-Mail)

5. User Flows
5.1 Adding an Item (Barcode)

User taps Scan Item

Camera opens

Scan success → query barcode API

API returns name/category

System applies shelf life

User confirms → item saved → appears in dashboard

5.2 Adding an Item (Manual)

User clicks Add Item

Enters name, category, purchase date

System suggests expiration date

User saves

5.3 Expiration Reminder

Daily scheduler runs

Find items within user’s notification range

Send push or email reminder

Mark reminder as sent in log

User receives notification

6. UI Wireframe Summaries
